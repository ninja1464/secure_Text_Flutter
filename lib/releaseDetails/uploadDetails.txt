long description
Secure Text is an innovative Android application designed to protect your sensitive information through robust encryption techniques. Whether you are sharing personal messages or confidential information, Secure Text ensures that only the intended recipient can read your messages. The app features a user-friendly interface with two main modes - 'Encrypt' and 'Decrypt' - allowing users to seamlessly switch between functions. Users can select from multiple encryption methods, including AES-GCM, AES-CBC, BASE64, and BASE32, to meet various security needs. To encrypt, simply enter the text in the 'Text String' field, provide a secure password, select the desired encryption method, and tap 'Encrypt'. The app will process the text and display the encrypted data in real-time. Decrypting is equally simple; enter the encrypted string and password, select the decryption method, and tap 'Decrypt' to reveal the original text. Secure Text includes a convenient 'Copy' button to quickly copy the encrypted or decrypted data to the clipboard for easy sharing. With real-time processing, Secure Text ensures a smooth user experience, making it ideal for securely communicating personal messages, protecting business information, and safeguarding important data such as passwords and account details.
